# Maarten_De_Podcast_Analysis
De 'Maarten van Rossem'-podcast is one of the most popular podcasts in The Netherlands, which has produced more than 300 episodes in the past 2 years. In this article, we produce some fun, and hopefully interesting, statistics about the podcast. This is done by collecting all the currently available podcasts from the web, and transcribing them using the newly available `Whisper` automated speech recognition model by [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper). After some initial statistical analysis of the podcast, finish our analysis by extracting topics from podcast using `BERTopic`, a Topic Modeling pipeline by [Maarten Grootendorst](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic). The goal of this project is first of all to have fun analysing the words of Maarten and Tom. I hope you'll learn something interesting from all this, enjoy!
